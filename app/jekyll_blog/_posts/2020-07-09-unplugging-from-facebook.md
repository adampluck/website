Hi friends,

I'm significantly changing how I use Facebook and other corporate social media. I'm not going to feed it, and I'm not going to let it feed me any longer.

* I'm not going to post on my Facebook profile or page. I may occasionally post in groups.
* I've set it up so I can't see my Facebook newsfeed on desktop or mobile (more on this below)

Essentially I'm just going to use Facebook as an **address book/events discovery/search tool** from now on.

I will also not be posting on Twitter, Instagram or YouTube. I already don't use the newsfeeds on Twitter or Instagram. I will continue to follow a handful of channels on YouTube that aren't available on Spotify.

## Where I will be posting

* ~daily: articles I read to my homepage ([web](https://stephenreid.net/), [RSS](https://stephenreid.net/feed.rss))
* ~weekly: blog posts to my blog ([web](https://stephenreid.net/blog), [RSS](https://stephenreid.net/blog/feed)), written with [Typora](https://typora.io/)
* ~occasionally: episodes to my [podcast](https://stephenreid.net/podcast)
* ~monthly: newsletters to my [Substack](https://stephenreid.substack.com/), which will feature a summary of content I've created since the previous newsletter

## How I read/listen

I discover articles via [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), including following a few Twitter accounts/Facebook pages converted with [FetchRSS](http://fetchrss.com/).

I listen to podcasts via Spotify and (reluctantly) YouTube.

## Hiding your Facebook newsfeed on desktop

Install Stylus ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/)) or Stylish ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/stylish/)), then install [this tiny script I wrote](https://userstyles.org/styles/186176/facebook-desktop-by-stephen-reid).

## Hiding your Facebook newsfeed on mobile

There's no way of hiding the newsfeed in the mobile app, so uninstall it and train yourself to only access Facebook through Firefox. Install [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/stylish/) and [this tiny script I wrote](https://userstyles.org/styles/186175/facebook-mobile-by-stephen-reid).
