title: "Responding to the requests of Seeds of Solidarity"
---

It has now been a week since I first read the testimonials by Solidarity & Rage/Seeds of Solidarity, which affected me deeply. To give some idea of how my feelings have evolved:

<style>
      ul {
        list-style-type: none;
      }
      ul li:before {
        content: '\2014';
        position: absolute;
        margin-left: -20px;
      }

</style>



* Shock, disbelief, indignance, fear and sadness, upon receiving the first email from the group
* Shame, fear, sorrow and anger, upon reading the testimonials
* Despair and anxiety followed by determination, upon receiving an email from a major media outlet
* Gratitude, love, hope and rectitude, upon seeing [thisisstephenreid.com](https://thisisstephenreid.com) which acknowledges the significant learning journey I've been on since the last of the allegations in 2017
* Acceptance, sadness, regret and remorse, as I totally switched off from social media

<br />Having had some time to reflect, converse and move through this process, I would like to address the collective's requests as a follow up to my [first blog](https://stephenreid.net/blog/2021/06/11/response-to-allegations-by-whoisstephenreid.html).

*Publicly acknowledge the serious harms outlined in the testimonials, the patterns of behaviour, and the deep hurt they have caused.*

I acknowledge that the testimonials show several people were really hurt by my irresponsible use of psychedelics, lack of care in intimate relationships, and lack of empathy over the period 2010-2017. Whilst there are details that I contest, I understand and accept the overall sentiment and I sincerely apologise to those that have been hurt by my past actions in connection with these topics.

I understand that since I was frequently in leadership positions I had a responsibility to exercise a particularly high standard of behaviour. Going forward, I am committed to the safe and responsible use of psychedelics, [healthy](https://doubleblindmag.com/consent/) and [empowering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auokDp_EA80) intimacy, and deep listening and empathy.

*Step back from leadership roles and ‘thought-leadership’ opportunities. This includes declining invitations to speak, deactivating his email newsletter, and resigning from leadership positions within current organisations.*

I have [stepped back from my role at Dandelion Collective](https://psychedelicsociety.org.uk/news/statement-from-the-psychedelic-societydandelion-collective-on-allegations-made-against-stephen-reid) (the parent organisation of The Psychedelic Society) whilst my colleagues receive independent advice on the way forward. I already held no formal leadership or ownership roles in the co-operative and decentralised organisations I work with.

Whilst I reflect further, I will not be accepting any speaking invitations nor use my email list for at least the rest of 2021. I will spend this time focusing on my learning journey, with the continued support of my UKCP-accredited psychotherapist.

*Stop publicly and privately co-opting anti-oppressive movements, such as intersectionality, shamanism and ecofeminism.*

I have no intention to speak or write on these topics.

*Engage in a therapeutic process with a UKCP-certified therapist (as alternative therapists are often complicit in spiritual bypassing) to enable understanding and acknowledgement of pain caused, and help prevent harmful and abusive behaviour in the future.*

I have been in therapy with my UKCP-affiliated therapist for six months now which has been pivotal in providing new perspectives on my past behaviour, and I am committed to continuing this process.

I request that this letter is published on [whoisstephenreid.com](https://whoisstephenreid.com).

May all find peace and healing,<br />Stephen
