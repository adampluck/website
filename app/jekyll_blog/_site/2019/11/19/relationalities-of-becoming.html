<p>The very nature of materiality is an entanglement. Matter itself is always already open to, or rather entangled with, the &quot;Other.&quot; The intra-actively emergent &quot;parts&quot; of phenomena are co-constituted. Not only subjects but also objects are permeated through and through with their entangled kin; the other is not just in one&#39;s skin, but in one&#39;s bones, in one&#39;s belly, in one&#39;s heart, in one&#39;s nucleus, in one&#39;s past and future. This is as true for electrons as it is for brittlestars as it is for the differentially constituted human... What is on the other side of the agential cut is not separate from us&ndash; agential separability is not individuation. Ethics is therefore not about right response to a radically exterior/ized other, but about responsibility and accountability for the lively relationalities of becoming of which we are a part.</p>
