You could of course pick a mix of these different options. For example,

*   50% CeFi, in [Metastrategy](/metastrategy)
*   50% DeFi, in [Index Coop/Bankless's BED](https://www.indexcoop.com/bed)

If you do choose to invest, consider <a href="https://www.degiro.co.uk/knowledge/strategies/what-is-dollar-cost-averaging">dollar-cost averaging</a> (investing equal sums of money at regular intervals) rather than going all-in.
