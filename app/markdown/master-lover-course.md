## Practice: Sensorial Awakening Meditation

![MAl](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/qWFbhcYVQdi7SOkC1Xg1)

*“Here in this body are the sacred rivers. Here are the sun and the moon, as well as all the pilgrimage places. I have not encountered another temple as blissful as my own body.”* - Saraha Doha (Tantra Scripture)

**Welcome to your practice :)**

One of the best ways to initiate the experience of a Tantra lifestyle is to open our senses to the maximum. You can achieve this by practicing a series of sensorial awakening meditations.

In Tantra practices, as we open fully and totally to this present moment we discover eternity. Lovers in deep orgasmic flow know this sublime state of being. The best way to dive into present moment awareness is through the body and the senses. This is so because the body is always in the here and now. The heart is beating now. Blood is flowing now. The pleasure of a caress happens in the present. By becoming attuned to our body and to our senses, we awaken a quality of spiritual aliveness and sensitivity.

When we are at ease about being immersed in this sensorial moment, it is then natural to take this total immersion into love relationship and into our sexual explorations. Being a Master Lover is all about the ability of being total and in the moment with whatever you are engaged in.

Try these powerful sensorial awakening meditations as a way to jump-start your Master Lover Exploration. You may be amazed just how easy it is to activate your sensual aliveness through immersing yourself in these practices. Each of the meditations listed here will activate not only physical sensitivity but also soul alignment, tapping into your intuition and psychic sensitivity as well

##   Chakra System

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/225809529" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" style="box-sizing: inherit;  width: 720px; height: 405px;"></iframe>

The ancient map of the chakra system is a great way to discover our human energy system.

**Let us explore our beautiful energy centers.**

This map it describes how Universal life force energy is reflected in our human body and energy system.

This discourse includes precise information on the opposite and yet complimentary polarities in the male and female chakras and how this impacts sexuality and male female relations.

I invite you to watch the video above to tune into your chakras alongside of me.

##   Chakra Dance

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/225809552" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" style="box-sizing: inherit;  width: 720px; height: 405px;"></iframe>

Welcome to the Chakra Dance meditation in the couple.

We can open the chakra system through dance & breath or even visualization, and in this case, we will open it by working with the positive polarities of male & female.

When you dance or breathe into a particular chakra with a positive polarity, the receptive polarity will automatically open as a result.

Watch the video above to learn how to practice this meditation.

**Note for Singles:**

In regards to the chakra system:

We all have an inner man or inner woman. The positive polarities in the chakra system are a description of a typical male gender body or female gender body. Our physicality does determine many things, including how energy flows in the chakra system. Our gender type influences brain development, hormonal system, emotional flow, psychology, physical strength, sexual attraction or repulsion, etc.

These things are hard-wired into our physicality.

Our environment in which we are raised also plays an important role and can create changes in our mindset or in biology.

About being single and practicing the chakra dance; you have two different ways you could practice it.

1) you can dance the positive poles in front of your projected inner man. In other words, you can imagine your inner man sitting in front of you and you can dance your positive poles in front of him. And you can sit down and imagine him dancing his positive poles in front of you. This can be very powerful.

The imprint of the man we carry within is what will manifest as an outer man at some point, i.e. the type of man you will attract towards yourself. By working with your inner man, it can help you to slowly, slowly transform the type of man you will draw towards you.

2) you can become your inner man and dance the first chakra / become your outer woman and dance the 2nd chakra / become your inner man and dance the third chakra / become your outer woman and dance the 4th chakra, and so on. This is also very powerful, as you will be stimulating the merging and melting of your inner man outer woman.

I suggest you experiment with both of these and find out what works for you.

About various sexual orientations:

Nature always seeks balance between yin and yang. So even in a same-sex couple, the polarities of yin and yang will play out. In general, one of the partners will tend to be more feminine while one will tend to be more masculine. In such a case, the couple can simply decide who wishes to play the masculine role and who wishes to play the feminine role.

If you look around you, there is always polarity at every turn: day and night, summer and winter, cold and hot, peaks and valleys, yin and yang. Tantra plays with these polarities and through them, discovers alchemical magic when both polarities meet.

Tantra is valuable no matter what one’s sexual orientation is just as it can be practiced whether you are in a relationship or single.

If you are single, as I said, you can work with your inner man or inner woman. If you are in a relationship, you can work with your beloved. Through this beloved, your inner man or inner woman will be mirrored in the outer man / outer woman.

##  Lecture: Female Self-Pleasuring

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/225809911" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" style="box-sizing: inherit;  width: 720px; height: 405px;"></iframe>

Why is self-pleasuring for a woman important to cultivate?

**When we self-pleasure as a woman we tap into our own innate wisdom which we can then share with our lover.**

A woman's sexual energy has to do with love in all it's form so the more we can cultivate self love, the more we can love all beings.

You need to be able to love yourself first and then share that as an empress with your lover as an overflowing delight.

Watch the video above to learn more.

The way sexual energy moves and the duration sexual pleasure lasts is largely dependent on how we have programmed ourselves through self-pleasuring, (masturbation) When a boy is growing up, there is a tendency to go into self-pleasuring furtively and quickly so as not to be discovered while in the act. Habitual repetition of this will eventually program the body to follow this well-trodden path, in any sexual situation, whether that be alone or with a lover.

**Self-pleasuring is such an important practice to cultivate.**

Other reasons why a man may tend to ejaculate quickly could be trauma associated with the genitals, such as having been genitally mutilated through circumcision or a very painful ending of a relationship, which included insults towards him about his manhood. The good news is, if you are not happy with how your sexuality has been programmed, you can deprogram yourself and install a new programming which is more in tune with your Tantra oriented lifestyle.

##  Practice: Self-Pleasure - Women

![Self](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/j5i6HQCTgaZAfxDu7XrA)

I have been teaching Tantra groups to women all over the world for many years. One of the important things I have discovered is that as a general rule, those women who do not practice self-pleasuring have difficulty to experience orgasm with a partner. This is so because our sexual response is programmed according to how we self-pleasure.

A woman who has self-pleasured in her childhood by lying face-down on a rolled-up blanket or long pillow, and then rubbing her body forward and backward, will need a similar kind of stimulation while having sex. A woman who has gotten into the habit of self-pleasuring by laying on her back, opening her legs and playing with her yoni with her hands and fingers, will need a similar kind of stimulation while with a lover.

In general, I have also found that many women have erroneous ideas about how a woman functions sexually and needs to let go of outdated ideas that are holding her back from being in her full ecstatic potential.

Being in a woman’s body means that we need to move from the exterior of the body and slowly, teasingly and progressively move towards the sex center taking at least 20 minutes for this slow approach.

In addition to this, ambiance and romance are really important for our entire sexual response. We need to feel loved, adored and even worshiped in order to open up fully and completely.

**A woman’s greatest ecstasy happens when she can be in a completely surrendered state of being.**

Instead of waiting for Mr. Right to offer us all of this on a golden platter, we are best served by offering what we need to ourselves. When a woman is able to truly love and pleasure herself, she will be able to truly love and enjoy being with a lover. And because she is living in a fulfilled state of being through her self-pleasure practice, she will simultaneously attract a complimentary lover, just as a flower emitting a sweet nectar attracts the bees and butterflies.

So now it's time for your own self-pleasure practice. You can check the previous video again for inspiration or use the document below for the guided step-by-step process.

##   Practice: Self-Pleasure - Men

![Him](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/VYI9nntRRgWCrPAiPLIc)

Many men are engaged in enthusiastic research to find out how to last longer in sex and how to experience full body orgasm without any loss of energy through ejaculation. According to ancient Tantra Texts from India and China, when a man ejaculates he loses his vital life force and if he can learn the art of moving his energy in and up rather than down and out, he can increase pleasure, sexual stamina and his longevity**.**

The way to train ourselves to last longer and to move our vital orgasmic energy in and up is by awakening the subtle energy channel running through the center of the body from the perineum in the root of the pelvic floor to the crown of the head. Our instinctual nature asks us to move our energy down and out for the purposes of procreation. But we don’t have sex only for procreation. Sex feels so good and is so fulfilling that there is an urge to go into it for pleasure. Tantrics found it is also possible to have sex for the purposes of spiritual rebirth, discovering cosmic orgasm.

**Take yourself on the adventure of discovering an entirely new way of approaching self-pleasuring.**

This methodology can liberate you from sexual dysfunction and open up new vistas in the landscape of your sexual experience. Once your central channel is open, you will easily and naturally begin experiencing inward and upward orgasmic flow, which some people refer to as *Injaculation.* When it happens the first time, it feels like a miracle. And yet, it is simply an invitation to yourself, to know all the ecstasy your body and soul are capable of. Once you have mastered doing this on your own, it will be time to explore your new found discovery with a lover.

I asked a friend who is a master of injaculation to describe to me exactly his technique if we can call it that. He said something, which I have noticed to be very true when I am making love with a man who has mastered this art. He said: *“it is like walking a tightrope between let go and relaxation and will and control. Sometimes I lean towards relaxation, and sometimes I lean towards control, and between these two, I find balance.”* By creating two banks, control and relaxation, the river of your life force is invited into an inward and upward flow.

Some men are concerned and think that they should master their ejaculatory urge to such an extent that they should never ejaculate. This is an unhealthy direction and indeed can be considered as a sexual dysfunction known as *Retarded Ejaculation*. Ejaculation is an involuntary reflex and is necessary for the health of the body from time to time. The only thing in question is the *frequency* of ejaculation. If ejaculation is used as a form of emotional release to get rid of emotional tensions or as a sleeping pill, this over use of the ejaculatory reflex will gradually diminish your physical strength. I know a man who was porn addicted and masturbated so often that eventually he became completely impotent.

It is important to learn the art of cultivating sexual energy and eventually mastering it. You can learn to become the master of your own energy, sometimes choosing to ejaculate and sometimes choosing to send your vital energy in and up into full body orgasmic states without the need to ejaculate. You have a full spectrum of possibilities inside of you and it is great to learn how to celebrate the whole rainbow of who you are!

So now it's time for your own self-pleasure practice. You can check the previous video again for inspiration or use the document below for the guided step-by-step process.

*“As between heaven and earth, movement must be balanced between the male and female elements. The male element absorbs the female one and is converted; the female element receives the male one and is transformed. The female and male elements must operate in complimentary ways.

![STH](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/ljXXOJ1SSWfFgfNDCc8c)

The Spiral to Heaven is a recipe of how to open your Beloved sexually through erotic Tantra methodology.

Each session should last somewhere around 40 minutes for each partner. (It is good to remember that you have already practiced warming up through ambiance and seduction phases).

It is fine to practice these as separate parts the first times you do this sequence but once you have mastered these different parts, it will be important to try all the various aspects of the Spiral to Heaven as one flow, ambiance, seduction and the Spiral to Heaven exchange.

Do make sure you watched the previous videos before you start your practice.
