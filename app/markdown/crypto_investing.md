CeFi stands for **Ce**ntralised **Fi**nance. Using these services means you're giving custody of your crypto to a company. If the company goes bust/gets shut down/your account gets blocked, you could lose your crypto. In that way it's similar to traditional banking.

DeFi stands for **De**centralised **Fi**nance. These services are non-custodial i.e. through the magic of blockchain you retain custody of your crypto â€” no third party is looking after it. You don't have the risk of a company going bust/getting shut down, and no company/government can stop you from accessing your crypto. Just don't lose your private key!
