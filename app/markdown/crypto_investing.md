<h1 class="text-center mb-3">Crypto investing: a very short introduction</h1>

CeFi stands for **Ce**ntralised **Fi**nance. Using these services means you're giving custody of your crypto to a company. If the company goes bust/gets shut down/your account gets blocked, you could lose your crypto. In that way it's similar to traditional banking.

DeFi stands for **De**centralised **Fi**nance. These services are non-custodial i.e. through the magic of blockchain you retain custody of your crypto — no third party is looking after it. You don't have the risk of a company going bust/getting shut down, and no company/government can stop you from accessing your crypto. Just don't lose your private key!

  <a href="/metastrategy">Metastrategy</a> is my strategy on ICONOMI. It's an automated strategy with daily rebalancing that is always an intelligent mix of the current top performing strategies, and is thus a great 'set-and-forget' option. <mark>This is my top recommendation for those new to crypto investing.   <a href="/metastrategy">See here for a step-by-step guide to investing in Metastrategy.</a></mark></p>
<p>
  You could also invest in 3-5 of the <a href="/iconomi">current top performing strategies</a>. If you choose this option I recommend you manually rebalance every 3-6 months (i.e. move your money out of any strategies that are now no longer in the top 5 and into the current top 5).</p>

You could of course pick a mix of these different options. For example,

*   50% CeFi, in [Metastrategy](/metastrategy)
*   50% DeFi, in [Index Coop/Bankless's BED](https://www.indexcoop.com/bed)

If you do choose to invest, consider <a href="https://www.degiro.co.uk/knowledge/strategies/what-is-dollar-cost-averaging">dollar-cost averaging</a> (investing equal sums of money at regular intervals) rather than going all-in.
