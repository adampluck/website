<p class="lead">I am currently accepting coaching clients as part of my training towards becoming an <a href="https://coachingfederation.org/credentials-and-standards">ICF-certified</a> transformational coach.</p>

How would it feel to be in conversation with someone who:

* helps you consider what you really want and how you can move towards it
* believes that you can change
* doesn’t claim to have all the answers for you
* cares and is interested
* holds up a mirror for you to see where you are part of your own problem
* trusts that you can find the answers you need through the power of a challenging but compassionate exploration?

If that sounds appealing, read on&hellip;

### What is coaching?

Coaching is a collaborative, non-directive dialogue practice that seeks to bring about change through inquiry, authenticity and a focus on outcomes.

It's based on the belief that people are creative, resourceful and capable of change, and already have, or otherwise can find, answers to their challenges.

*Transformative* coaching is a coaching style with a particular focus on exploring the inner world of beliefs, assumptions, values and expectations.

### Who can benefit?

Coaching is of most benefit to those who are:

* Mentally well and robust
* Broadly ready and able to change
* Seeking improvement and growth
* Focused on achieving outcomes
* Willing to engage in self-exploration
* Open-minded as to what might be holding them back

### Coaching vs mentoring, teaching, therapy and counselling

Coaching can be distinguished from mentoring and teaching (where the mentor/teacher is typically an expert in the subject and actively offers advice), and therapy and counselling (where the focus is typically on emotional challenges in the past or present, rather than achieving a vision for the future). It's possible to benefit from coaching whilst also working with a mentor, teacher, therapist or counsellor.

### Interested in working together?

I offer an initial free half-hour exploratory call, so we can see if we are well-suited to one another.

From there, my preference is for us to meet for an hour each week via Zoom and continue until we feel a sense of completion.

I charge £10-50 per hour, according to your means. This is self-assessed; you just tell me how much you want to pay.

I would expect you to attend sessions on time and from a quiet place, free from distractions. If you need to cancel or reschedule a session, I would not charge as long as you provide at least 24 hours notice.

Sessions are recorded, with recordings shared with you confidentially shortly after each session for your reflection and review. I might sometimes ask your permission to share a recording with my supervisor as part of my training.
