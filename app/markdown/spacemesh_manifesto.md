We are the Weirdos, the Freaks, the Misfits--and whatever such labels you want to slap onto us. We see the fake autonomy you've been selling for the **trap** it truly is--values traded for ashes by the blind force of ‘rationality’, trying to reduce us all to **“rational” automatons**, robot duplicators of the past, even though, since the dawn of history, we’ve known better than to be run by any script!

Reality is irrefutably NOT mere signs (words, numbers, symbols) and mathematical logic--distractions that have been pushed on us as the guiding obsession of the systems we’re forced to participate in. **These things are not the organizing grammar and governing dynamics of the universe!** The real world--the actual *real world*--desperately needs our attention. We ask to stop being forced to take part in this extractive “Boomer’s heaven”. We want to get busy collaborating, rebuilding the **wreckage of the human psyche** that has been so ‘graciously’ left to us.

We watch in disgust as the war ravages between good and evil. But it is all sound and fury, signifying nothing; ‘experts’ and leaders ignoring the complexity of the world, offering overly-simple and often stupid solutions to the problems we face. The dubious competence and moral decay of our governing elites undermines any **claim of legitimacy** that can justify the overwhelming power that they hold on us. Time is running out on their dying way of life. The morphing of politics into a stage for crime at the largest scale, the crumbling of morality, and growing corruption are no accident. Rather, they are proof that the **creative potential of the nation-state paradigm has been exhausted**. Our world is now engulfed in the low politics of self-interest: we make decisions solely based upon what we commonly fear, or because it fits the “bottom line”.

*Once again, our Kings and Queens are naked on global television. Will this ever stop?*

In a future book, that would surely be titled **How Humans Pushed Themselves into a Corner**, the morbid tale of ‘how pseudo rationality brought humans to their doom’ will be told. It starts with a truly marvelous creature, with a gigantic, creative mind. A creature without any evolutionary precedent. Then, with the scientific revolution of the 17th century and the rise of geniuses like Sir Isaac Newton, who invented calculus and modern physics, and giant philosophers like Emmanuel Kant, a new promising era has emerged.



This era marks the future horizons of modern science and thinking as well as the promise of a liberating new model for our socio-political way of life. From this point onward, humans were no longer merely unique among the species on the planet. This marked the point from which these humans claimed to be breaking free from the constraints of nature itself, leaping forward in every measurable category of achievement and production. **#GOTEAMHUMAN**

 

But the height of supremacy also marked the height of a self-aggrandizing delusion. The fate of **Icarus**, whose hubris brought him down from the skies to his doom, was also the fate of humanity in the 20th century. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the 20th century saw humans grow arrogant in the wake of their mind-boggling success. The hubris that came with the success of modern science and achievements of the enlightenment rose to new heights. Newton, who modestly admitted that he **saw so far ahead since he stood on the shoulders of giants**, was replaced by intellectual dwarfs arrogantly confident in their powers to subjugate and control Nature.

This ushered in an era where humans tried to subject their natural language and the language of money to the almighty new patron: “Science”. Naive and unaware, and perhaps somewhat drunk on self-importance, placing the newly-discovered “Science” as the exclusive measure for intelligibility, humans endeavored now to resolve once and for all eternity the great enigma of the universe. By emphasizing reason over superstition and science over blind faith, humans decided to demand a “higher standard” for knowledge, asserting that only “**scientific truth**” is valid.

THIS mistake: to demand a bedrock all-exhausting explanation for the enigma of the great nonlinear complex universe, broken down into complicated linear ‘science’ blocks--the (narcissistic) demand to subject the complexity of creation to a simplified order--led to a slippery slope. Essentially, in failing to realize that, as a species, **we simply don't have the capacity to disentangle facts and values**!



The values and theories one has acquired over the course of one’s life heavily influence how one sees the world, and thus how “facts” are perceived. In subscribing to this idea of “facts independent of theories”, humans endeavoured to champion extreme overspecialization and local optimums, leading to soaring inequality and environmental degradation. This led to questions of morality like “does rising overall wealth justify such gross inequality?”, only for them to be erroneously answered with “Science”. And “Science” determined that these local optimums are both necessary and inevitable.

 

And, **o****opsy!**, by accepting this dogma of “scientific truth”, a grammar from a *supposedly* omniscient POV, we lost sight of our “metaphysical blindspot”. And in so doing, all of us collectively lost the ability to interact with reality ethically, unknowingly tumbling down, down, ever-further down a rabbit hole of wickedness. And what we found at the bottom is not Wonderland, but the Matrix.



We have failed to adapt, failed to introduce new fairness models fast enough to meet the challenges of our rapidly-evolving reality. This is a modern “scientific” tendency designed solely in order to defend and justify the status quo simply because it exists, at the expense of courageous individuals and the collective best interest. We are duplicating past decisions symmetrically, unable to stop: a perpetual motion machine of ever more self-destructive stupidity.

 

Don’t get us wrong: the Scientific Operating System is undeniably *useful*, converting reality into a *model of reality* in the highest possible fidelity, offering great insight and practical substance. There’s a catch, though: our universe is not prefigured and unchanging, but rather novelty occurs all the time. Our universe is truly **creative**! Infinite potential space for your algorithms to explore and search, without any hint that our discoveries will ever come to an end. Your algorithmic efforts are **practical** yet not **fundamental** in an infinite universe. They cannot provide a foundation to anything that is *for sure* and *forever*. Nor can it deduce any ultimate, immutable truth. Most importantly, it **cannot provide a foundation for MORALITY!**



And yet, this is precisely what Boomers claimed “science” could do, giving it power over our autonomous decision making everywhere and in every possible methodology. They did this because it allowed them to win in rivalrous contests (warfare, extraction, production, information control, narrative manipulation). The only governance of this approach is the economics that funds it, and game theory is its only ethical system. **There was no room for morality in this house of cards that they built****.**

 

The great Enlightenment project of formulizing morality has failed. A kind of cargo cult where people are speaking moral soundbites despite the entire ‘moral-discourse’ long having entered a state of incoherence. **This is a moral catastrophe**.  The far bigger part of us are generally good folks and yet reality seems to be getting nastier and malevolent by the second, because Humans are now utterly lost in a **savage feedback loop** that rewards risk aversion and the exploitation of words and financial short-term bottom-lines and Punishes the people of Action and the Value Creators.

 

The Kantian **categorical imperative**, once acting before the moral dilemma we must act as if we legislate a universal law, binding to all -- can be easily and wrongly read as saying: If we obey rationality, as philosophy teaches us, we must all as rational beings act the same – **and even worse, be the same**! This is not only a mistaken read but a recipe for evil to flourish. The idea that the rules for human behavior and morality will always be set in stone everywhere, for all times, dictating the same for all humans - is itself a guarantee that we will inevitably spin down into immorality.

 

Consider the simple scenario of witnessing a drawing man, and the all-embracing rule: “*If I can swim, I jump to save; I do not know how to swim, I call for help*”. The idea that there is only one pool of ethics and one swimming teacher and we all learn to “ethically swim” in the same manner is **extremely dangerous**.



This is so because it requires that the world remain static, and that those who believe in such principles must take proactive measures to enforce that stasis. Those who curse the “reactionaries” and the “counter-revolutionaries” will themselves become the ultimate enforcers of a pathological hyper-conservatism. Until the system collapses under the weight of its own stagnation, that is. This process **inherently, by its very nature**, by force of internal inertia alone, intensifies to the point of inevitable discharge and collapse of the kind we have already encountered, for example, in the 2008 crisis. **Spectacularly failing to protect any of the interests of the commons****.**

 

Both government and free markets are naturally resistant to ethics. If it were up to the markets, there would be a market for human trafficking, organ-harvesting, and contract killing. And so, for binding and limiting this predatory aspect of markets, we have  the nation state, rule-of-law, police, military and etc. However, these monopolies on violence present a tempting venue by which predatory individuals or interest groups may exploit the citizens of the nation state. It thus falls to those citizens--we the people--to check the power of the state.



But what happens when folks' inability to disentangle facts and values can be used to polarize and divide the public from ever agreeing on what constitutes an abuse of power by the state? Or the flaunting of ethics by the market? **1, 2, 3,  VOILA!** Within a mere century, those who claim to be able to set the principles on which we all ought to agree cannot secure agreement on the formulation of those principles. Not even from the very colleagues who share their basic philosophical purpose and method. And for as long as we stay in this wasteland of polarization, there will literally be nothing to take care of any of our common interests.

 

This is the paradigm that Westerners then enforced on all other cultures, with this fake ideal labeled “scientific truth”. A private clock ticking private time to be used as the measure by which all the public clocks must set, under the claim that the private clock is ideal, perfect, and true. Behind the idea of “scientific truth” as the driver of human progress lies a **fundamental fallacy**.  A dirty little secret, which is not just wrong--but *doubly* wrong:

1. Science can at best tell us what IS (within limits) but not what OUGHT to be. It inherently can NOT function as our moral compass. The way something *is* tells us NOTHING about how it *must* be, and certainly not how it *should* be.
2. By using science as our monolithic compass, we cannot possibly avoid scientific thinking from becoming an ideology itself, thereby undermining the very thing that makes science such a useful tool in the first place.

Rather than arriving at “the ideal model” of a “a global-flat world” or “the end of history”, what we actually arrived at is nothing more than a regional optimum relevant only within a very specific guarded locality, be it geographical, political or historical, shrouded in a camouflage of omnipresent, everlasting relevancy. In constructing this ever-accelerating train on its collision-course crossing path with disaster, did nobody ever stop to think: “**what if we're gonna need to slow the train down**?”! Is it even still possible at all?! And if not, how do we regroup now as to be able to constructively stand up to the aftermath of such a historical catastrophe?!

 

*“The tendency to value our own form of civilization as higher--not as dearer to our hearts--than that of the whole rest of mankind, are the same as those which prompt the actions of primitive man, who considers every stranger as an enemy, and who is not satisfied until the enemy is killed.“* -- Franz Uri Boas

In fact, our polarization is not a bug, but a feature of their world OS, every Force Majeure and every Unforeseen event (basically all the time), leaves us a duplicating past decisions rather than incentivizing us to migrate courageously and peacefully towards a readjusted, fairer, expanding frame of the future.

 

You see?! In fact, we are imprisoned by 2D images that hide an entire 3D logical space of decisions and behaviors that are deemed ‘irrational’, and therefore we do not even begin to further explore them. Yet we generally “stick to the script” to create trust, to signal to each other we can be trusted, we play together by a script written decades ago.  Many things have changed in the past 300+ years and yet behind our backs and without our notice, a 2D image of rationality dictating “how to behave regardless of who you are and regardless of circumstance,” was forcibly inscribed into our minds by society, by “our kind,” transmitted from mother and father to daughter and son as an irreplaceable “truth” for everyone, everywhere and for all time. Thereof: quarantining whatever spontaneous nature one has so as to ensure that one dares not to explore outside of the guarded fences. We have all become compulsive liars without noticing.

By passing this conspiracy onwards, we make double sure our kind will not explore the 3D logical space any further. They say: Stick to the 2D image! Thereby systemically foil our efforts to arrive at any of the solution-spaces essential for us to transcend from these mediocre local optimums. The more you believe there is one way we all owe to behave, you become an autopilot duplicator of past decisions, losing your own sense of individuality and consequently the ability to act autonomously.  Others even your closest benevolently program you how to behave, by simply repeating wformulatehat's acceptable and not allowing for exploration in the irrational, for making sense for oneself.

However, the failure of “rational”, “science”-based neoliberalism does not mean that its most prominent “rivals” are superior. This is the reason why Communism failed, and the reason why any other Globalist or “internationalist” agenda will also fail, no matter how much it’s sugar-coated with feel-good buzzwords like ‘fairness’, ‘equality’,  ‘justice’, and the most recent go-to’s: ‘renewable energy’ and ‘saving the planet’. The road to hell is paved with the good intentions of arrogant, self-important oligarchs and technocrats. Any monolithic top-down system of control and power can't help but spin-down to evil, fail, break and dissolve. There’s a systemic compulsion: to surveille, to control, to restrict, creating a feedback loop of evil that accelerates over time.

Our current evolutionary trajectory is unable to break out of this disastrous loop. We have been taught to exchange and socialize with the deformed-by-design tools of[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/spacemesh/relearning-how-to-play-the-langue-and-money-games-d659b3171b8a&sa=D&ust=1609856746177000&usg=AOvVaw0RD3vqpipZ3tw23XZgeQsY)[Money and Language](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/spacemesh/relearning-how-to-play-the-langue-and-money-games-d659b3171b8a&sa=D&ust=1609856746177000&usg=AOvVaw0RD3vqpipZ3tw23XZgeQsY), that are no longer adequate to keep up with today’s pace of change. These gauging tools--money as a gauge of value and economical exchange, and meanings as a gauge of words and tools of communication--underwent an artificial reconstruction that bears only a superficial syntactic resemblance to the tools we really need. These tools are now grossly out of touch with our material needs and circumstances. They are by design powerless in advancing the context of our times.

A sense of anxiety about the future tints today with the existential angst of Western societies. Younger generations everywhere are hesitant and worried; warning signs of imminent peril are everywhere, along with cries for change.  We are no doubt, at times, between worlds, in Mobil Ave, the in between worlds train station of the Matrix, in the bizarre transitional phase of hegemonic rollover. A liminal space wherein the longtime hegemonic force which dominated the world system goes into decay. During such times, there is no clear overarching order to the world system. Not until another hegemony locks in. We bear witness to a transformation of the system of the world.



An utterly new and utterly different world order is coming. The 4th phase in human evolution: the postindustrial, postmodern, post politics, and, in fact, posthuman (in-as-much as “human” is to be understood in terms of the artificial design we were offered in this ending phase). Indeed, for some of us it has already begun. Those of us who engage now with the sort of radical thinking of the kind that literally lives between worlds; the kind that attempts at a **HARD REBOOT** of the very fundamental machine level of human existential-infrastructure.



*After the commercials, the* ‘*End of History’ zeitgeist pushes humanity over a cliff. Don't you dare look away from your screen.*



We now face a chance the magnitude of which has few precedents in history: an entirely new realm of economic activity which is not hostage to fiscal violence at all, and which will emerge in cyberspace. New kinds of **intersubjective logical spaces;** “everywhereness” we can all enter and experience. If we get it right, it could herald a break with the past so profound that it could bring us to the magical domain of the gods. This newly-awoken part of our collective brain, which appreciates complexity and creativity; which cares about synchronization, velocity, and coherence; which can transcend our inner narcissist and bind us all together. It is our hope and belief that Creative, Generative Collaboration will do an exponentially better job of processing the world in a non-linear high-complexity fashion. Because we now know how to do better, aware of the inescapable “system of justification” we create to navigate between possible and actual. We thus become aware of the significance of advancing this “context surface” over time, rather than holding it static and duplicating our decisions.

 

**What’s Crypto Got to Do with Anything?**

 

In Satoshi’s vision of magic internet money, where everyone can join via mining from home, lies a proposition for a new global social order. By purging us from fake fiat money we can begin to untangle some of the mess modern positivism has done.  We believe in this vision: in handing power to the people, to art, to what will ultimately shape collective consciousness. For contributing for such a future, (step#1) **fully permissionless and fully decentralized programmable cryptocurrency infrastructure** is a necessary yet insufficient condition.

 

(step#2) Fixing the *‘tragedy of the commons’* governance problem. The reason our oceans are full of toxic sludge, and our air is full of smog, is a tragedy of the commons type problem. A situation where a vital resource has shared ownership and shared stewardship, yet no one has the financial incentive to invest in its costly upkeep and maintenance. Information in the public domain - what we collectively hold as truth and base our solution proposals upon - has the exact same problem. Most of the information in the commons' space is useless noise. You only need to look at social media to see this in action: every interest holder is a kind of chimney, spreading informational pollution as easily as blowing smoke in the air. We must start by freeing truth from the hands of corporate interests. The asymmetric information campaign, for example, that Facebook runs, with both its quantity and quality/processing-ability of information, makes the CIA command of the information battlefield look in comparison like child’s play. Meanwhile, we the commons are at the very other end of that spectrum: victims of asymmetric information warfare fueled by ever-improving AI technology that had never existed in the past - making command of information many orders of magnitude more asymmetric than ever before in history.

 

Lazy, over-specialized minds tend to be especially “tribalized”. Almost no one, and certainly not the media, has the ability nor the interest to process these complex matters adequately. Most have simply given up on trying to do a rigorous job of making sense of things themselves. Instead, we are paying attention to what feels true, or what “people like me” tend to think. Or even simply what we’re being exposed to the most. In taking the lazy way out, by allowing our critical thinking to be overridden by echo chambers, the basic necessary conditions for collective choice-making do not exist. It's actually very cognitively expensive to keep ourselves educated and engaged--to take active interest in matters not immediate to ourselves--because there’s little to provide an incentive or motivation to do so. It’s much easier to binge watch youtube videos and browse our social media feeds. And the proof is in the pudding: the vast majority of us don’t engage in any kind of politics outside of rallying around some person we hardly know anything about every four years.

 

Regardless of your political views: if you can’t think of a good reason why millions of people disagree with you passionately, then chances are you don’t actually understand the sacred values that drive them to that disagreement. And this is where toxic tribalism takes over. Left (progress) and Right (conservative) are both obviously correct. Our movement must both be anchored in what worked well in the past and in new circumstances, and new problems (e.g facebook) it brings. Freedom of speech is an excellent example of a great idea in 1700, but which is now clearly being abused by an algorithm that optimizes *time-on-site,* and which just so happens to include *limbic hijacking*. (The deliberate use of mechanisms that tap into the reward systems of our brains in order to keep us coming back for more.)  What is it that freedom of speech was originally designed to protect us from? Is it not the stagnation of our society from mental and intellectual atrophy? If we can agree that this is the purpose, then it’s time for freedom of speech to receive a modern reinterpretation--one which accounts for the way freedom of speech is presently being weaponized to numb our minds.

 

Fixing the *‘tragedy of the commons’* governance problem is at the heart of fixing *‘information commons’* problem. In our quest for unity, it’s perhaps ironic that decentralization represents a first-of-its-kind viable governance solution that is **necessary yet insufficient** to deal with such problems. Because it’s only once our money-ledger is resistant to “pollution” that truth can genuinely begin to emerge from markets.  In the meantime, we remain dependent on individuals stewarding the *‘information commons’,* doing the hard work of making sense for themselves, and preparing for engagement. And in these times of great volatility and upheaval, these efforts must be better incentivized.

 

We must then boot a new system for **participatory governance**, which history tells us comes in conjunction with **cultural enlightenment**:

(1) getting enough people to stop doubling down on their own biases and reorient themselves towards Collective Sense-Making, Collective Meaning-Making, and Collective Conversation Culture.

(2) building a system that is chiefly concerned with investing in and motivating the capacity to do these collective tasks well.

 

The benefits of declining ‘returns on violence’ (in a world that is increasingly in the realm of the digital, physical violence is increasingly obsolete) and ‘dissolving jurisdiction’ (digital spaces are much more difficult to confine with ‘borders’) includes things such as non-polarised upward mobility, and far more equal opportunities for what will soon be eight billion people. A scope by which every energetic individual can benefit from the death of politics by exploring unbounded space together, free from both governmental oppression, racial and ethnic prejudice, and physical violence.



**TRUTH BECOMES WHAT WE REALISE AS SUCH WHILE WE DREAM ABOUT PARADISE TOGETHER**

 

"*The future is disorder. A door like this has cracked open five or six times since we got up on our hind legs. It is the best possible time to be alive, when almost everything you thought you knew is wrong.*" --Tom Stoppard, Arcadia

**What are we facing?**



This train is blazing in a mounting surge for 4-5 generations with no sign of slowing down in sight.  By today we face a  superordinate crisis, which is the meta-crisis. The heart of the issue, the nature of human choice making, self understanding, and capacity.

\1.  **Capacity Crisis**: We’ve ended up building a civilization where the problems we’re confronting have become so complex so quickly that there’s a lag in the human capacity to make the upgrade needed to meet them. We have a growing number of problems that are too complex to solve.

\2.  **Legitimacy Crisis**: We can’t figure out who is the one with the legitimate authority, but it’s even deeper because it’s about the legitimacy of authority, period. There’s been an absence of legitimate teacherly authority in the schools and universities for quite a while. That is what has produced the more widespread sense of illegitimacy across most of our major institutions. This has been the case for a while now.

\3.  **Meaning crisis**,  There’s also a sense of, “We don’t know what we’re about as a species or a nation or even an individual.” What’s the meaning of the suffering? What’s the meaning of the joy? What’s the meaning of death, sleep, and dreams? There’s such a dimension of cultural incoherence here.  This growing space of the question mark, in the place where there should be actual meaning. This is the void that the conspiracy theory industrial complex exploits in order to gain a foothold.

\4.  **Intelligibility crisis**, which is to say, as opposed to capability crisis, if we’re able to understand anything at the level of cognitive sense-making. To make sense on one’s own or rather listen to what feels true, and spin down unconsciously to propaganda land, it’s a sense-making crisis.



All these 4 problems are inside of us all. Skills residing within humans, within the interiors.  Which is to say these are not infrastructure failures, they are the conditions for the possibility of infrastructure failures. They are not political breakdowns; they are the condition for the possibility of political breakdowns. They are prior to them because they reside within the human psyche and body. They are within and they need to be grappled within the dimension of consciousness and the learning cycle of human developmental education. Boomers have been so poorly managing our education systems, since about 1972, that we are looking at a breakdown of intergenerational transmission. They reduced education to the lowest common denominator that is required in order to reproduce the economic system and as a consequence ended up pushing into the margins and actually offloading key crucial externalities into the other dimensions of intergenerational transmission. For example, ethics, meaning making and legitimacy were thrown off road to make room to the instrumental mechanics of achieving technical economic goals.  

 

 

**What’s our philosophy?**

 

“Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned.” Marshall Mcluhan 🤴🏼 1964

 

- Reality is complex and has cause and effect relationships invisible to us directly, the way a  fish is unaware of the ever-present waters around. Humans, unlike fish however,  placed themselves at the center of the world’s intelligibility, and began focusing on a specific static picture-like implementation, rather than subscribing to pre-implementation principles. It is in this move that we have grown unable to re-render modern interpretation with ancient inscribed in stone principles that we have always known to be true and that are anchored in 13 billion years of evolution. This is a break from the tree of knowledge so severe that it is befitting of the biblical tale of “falling out of heaven”.
- We now know better than to run by script, instead we wish to open our eyes wide:  “Look, Don't Think” tells us the great 20th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. It is only via confiscating and privatizing judgment away from these imaginary “collective frames” of judgment; in looking hard and making sense for ourselves, through our individual “private frames” of judgment, in seeking to own our own frame (different, informed and yet not determined by others)  that we could possibly express individualism in navigating our way in the labyrinth of reality. Our most important principle is thereby to think in a principled way: Hyper-realism embracing reality, seeing how reality works and having effective ways for dealing with reality (i.e. principles).   
- We now understand that our actualization is not literally the same as that of the animal and yet it must sustain continuity with that frame, “living things can actualize matter in a way that the inorganic process never can”. However great care is needed in order to utilize this unique capability. Creation requires protection and feeding. We must then afford and provide resources and care for the Thermodynamic Labor of exploring adjacent possibilities, for increasing probability space, not only securing my share.   
- Lastly, while once it rains all gets wet, the water tends to stay in valleys and from there to lakes and rivers when the geographical conditions are right. Same pattern occurs with value distribution, Real-Estate owners (like valley landowners) get to keep an un-proportional amount of the value. Our new precious virtual real-estate space, must then by necessity be owned, held, and maintained by the commons. Our gauge for success is thus derived from advancing our capacities to distribute the value created, deducted-from and aligned-with individual contribution to the whole.

 

**What is Smesh?**

 

“**I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor.**” -- Henry David Thoreau

 

A new human mesh, New Social Operating System, A dominant attractor for a subculture, A new generative collaborative framework for Artists, Makers, Builders, Coders, and other such non pretentious, non-”intellectual” humans.



Ours is a mesh that allows for people to take back their agency while still reaping the benefits of a highly connected world. Empowering individuals to take charge of their local communities, while still being part of a decentralized global network, allows for a more robust, adaptable system that is harder to ‘hack’. This friction is vital to create a system that can adapt to, rather than ignore, changing circumstances and shocks. Growth is replaced with an Increase of probabilities for all equitable and sustainable.

# **Why Spacemesh****?**

# If we are to ask the younger generation attention to this technology, we must by necessity offer them a better “Deal”, riskless barrier for entry and forever fair towards the small miners, even in face of “whales” or otherwise surge in demand.

As pillars that ensure Permissionless Decentralization work together and uphold each other: if even 1 of the pillars is not achieved, the entire promise of cryptocurrency is in jeopardy. Any compromise on this in exchange for other properties such as speed or resilience fails to incorporate the canonical aspect of the problem at hand.





*Thus on Spacemesh we have introduced 3 design constraints:*

1. *Whoever wants to join can do so easily,* **no creditcard nor kyc required***.*
2. *One joins by spending resources, ideally such most of us have in abundance already at home (1+2=* **riskless barrier for entry***).*
3. **No “Priceout”***: any miner will continue to mine profitably, for until a miner chooses to stop mining. Thus, ongoing operational cost,  must remain negligible, even under whale surge.*
