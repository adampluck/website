<h1 class="mb-3">ICONOMI fund evaluator</h1>

The score of a fund is calculated as:

(4 &times; 1 month performance %) + (3 &times; 3 month performance %) + (2 &times; 6 month performance %) + (1 &times; 1 year performance %)

The fee-weighted score is:

score &times; (1 - management fee %) &times; (1 - performance fee %) &times; (1 - entry fee %) &times; (1 - exit fee %)

All scores/returns on this page are normalised in the range 0&ndash;100.

When using ICONOMI, I suggest you invest across a number of different top-performing funds, rather than having all your eggs in one basket 🍳 Use the controls below to receive a **proposed position** across your chosen number of funds.
