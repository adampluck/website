          Working with Stephen was something else. He held space for me to tap into a truly authentic and deeply honest version of myself, and guided me through a journey that really helped me understand my values and how to use them to make challenging life decisions at a key inflection point in my life. I felt so "seen" by Stephen whenever we spoke: he both allowed me to be my complete self whilst also challenging me on some of the stories I was telling myself. I'd highly recommend Stephen as a coach and truly think he's one of the best people to have by your side through the ups the downs of life.
